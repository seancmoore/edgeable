            This guide explains exactly how to read my daily card, what each part means, and how to
            responsibly tail my plays over the long term. And yes — a lot of this was drafted with AI,
            but read it anyway. It gets across everything I'd want you to know.

              <p className="mt-2">Examples: <span className="font-mono text-xs">OSU -2 · Under 5.5 · ATL +3 · Under 109.5 (1H)</span></p>

              <p className="mt-1">
                Next to the play are the odds I personally locked in (e.g. -110, -105, -101). Keep in mind:
              </p>

              ]} />
              <p className="mt-2">
                That's why I strongly recommend having access to as many sportsbooks as possible. The more
                books you have, the closer you'll get to my number (or even beat it), the more long-term
                edge you preserve, and the less value you bleed over time. You don't need to match my exact
                odds, but getting close matters — I send cards in advance for a reason. If odds didn't
                matter, I'd just upload to Action Network and fire the card 10 minutes before tip-off.

                The number on the far right (e.g. 4.5u, 5.25u) is how many units I'm wagering on that play.
                A unit is a fixed, small fraction of your bankroll — not a set dollar amount for everyone.
                You convert it to a dollar figure once, then never change it.

              <Bullets items={[
                'If 1 unit = $10, then 5u = $50',

              ]} />
              <p className="mt-2">
                You decide what a unit is before you start, and it should never change based on emotion or
                confidence.

          <Section title="2. Why Units Matter More Than Dollars">
            <p>On the official card, I avoid flat staking and any “feel for the amount” approach. Units let me:</p>
            <Bullets items={[
              'Scale positions properly',
              'Control risk',
              'Stay consistent through swings',
              'Avoid emotional decisions (this is the most important)',
            ]} />
            <p>
              Some plays carry more edge than others — that's why unit size varies. I use a rough model to
              decide how much to risk on each play. That said, there will be times I put more on a play than
              the math strictly justifies, based on personal feel — and I'll usually tell the channel when
              I've juiced the risk. If I don't say anything, a good rule of thumb: anything over 6 units has
              some personal opinion baked in.

                This is not a mistake, a collapse, or a sign the strategy “stopped working.” This is variance.

              <p className="mt-2">
                If you're checking your balance after every play, tilting after one bad day, chasing losses,
                or scaling units emotionally — this approach is not for you.

              <strong className="text-foreground">What I personally run: 1,000 units.</strong> Once I turned
              21, I split my bankroll into 1,000 units. At that size, I rarely have more than 0.5% of my
              bankroll on a single wager — so I don't feel the need to watch the games, and I don't tilt when
              a play loses. The whole goal is to stay out of any position where I'd get emotional.

          <Section title="5. The Chase System (Baseball)">
            <p>
              Baseball is different from other sports because teams play in <strong className="text-foreground">series</strong>.
              In the NBA the Knicks might play the Bulls tonight and the Warriors tomorrow — a new opponent
              almost every night. In MLB, when the Yankees play the Orioles they'll usually face them 2–4
              games in a row. That back-to-back structure is what makes <strong className="text-foreground">“chasing”</strong>{' '}
              a play possible: we get multiple cracks at the same edge, against the same matchup, on consecutive days.
            </p>

            <div>
              <div className="font-medium text-foreground">How a chase works</div>
              <p className="mt-1">
                Some of my plays are <strong className="text-foreground">chase plays</strong>. Instead of a
                one-and-done entry, we ride the play through the games of the series until it hits — or until the
                series runs out. Every chase is built to win <strong className="text-foreground">5 units net</strong>.
                If it wins in game 1, we're done. If it loses, we size the next entry to recover what we lost{' '}
                <em>and</em> still net our 5 units, then run it back in the next game of that series. Chases run on
                a <strong className="text-foreground">three-game series</strong>, so it's at most three entries
                (games 1, 2, and 3) — if it still hasn't hit after game 3, the chase is over and we take the loss.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <div className="font-medium text-foreground">Example — “Under 8.5” chase</div>
              <ol className="ml-5 mt-1 list-decimal space-y-1 marker:text-muted-foreground">
                <li>Game 1: risk 5u to win 5u on the Under 8.5. If it cashes → <strong className="text-foreground">+5u</strong>, chase over.</li>
                <li>Game 2 (only if game 1 lost): risk 10u to win 10u — that recovers the 5u we lost and still nets 5u.</li>
                <li>Game 3 (only if still losing): risk 20u to win 20u — recovers the 15u lost plus our 5u target.</li>
              </ol>
              <p className="mt-2">
                If it never hits by the end of game 3, the chase is over and we take the loss — we don't carry a
                chase into a different series. (Exact stake sizes shift a bit with the odds; the idea is each step
                wins back the prior losses plus 5 units.)
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2">
                One note on the number itself. A chase is named for a number, like Under 8.5 for the Mariners, but
                you always take the line that's actually posted for that game. If the total for a later game in the
                series is higher than 8.5, say it sits at 9 or 9.5, take that posted line. A higher number on an
                Under only works in your favor, and that's the line that counts as the system play.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <div className="font-medium text-foreground">The ML / +1.5 System</div>
              <p className="mt-1">
                One specific chase keys off a <strong className="text-foreground">team name</strong> instead of a
                fixed play type. When the play just reads a team — say <span className="font-mono text-xs">Yankees</span>{' '}
                for their series vs. the Orioles — the play each game depends on whether the Yankees are favored:
              </p>
              <Bullets items={[
                'Favored that game → play their moneyline (ML).',
                'Underdog that game → play their +1.5 run-line spread.',
              ]} />
              <p className="mt-2">
                It's still one continuous chase to net 5 units; only the play type flips game-to-game with their role.
              </p>
              <div className="mt-2 font-medium text-foreground">Walkthrough</div>
              <ol className="ml-5 mt-1 list-decimal space-y-1 marker:text-muted-foreground">
                <li>Game 1: Yankees are underdogs → play <span className="font-mono text-xs">+1.5</span> to win 5u. They lose by 3, so the +1.5 doesn't cover — chase continues.</li>
                <li>Game 2: Yankees are now favorites → play their ML to win back the 5u we lost + 5u more (10u). They lose again.</li>
                <li>Game 3: Yankees are favorites again → play their ML to win back everything lost + 5u more.</li>
              </ol>
            </div>

            <div className="rounded-lg border border-warning/30 bg-warning/5 p-4">
              <div className="mb-2 flex items-center gap-2 font-medium text-warning">
                <AlertTriangle className="h-4 w-4" /> This is a system — not emotional chasing.
              </div>
              <p>
                Don't confuse this with the loss-chasing I warn about in Section 3. A chase here is a{' '}
                <strong className="text-foreground">pre-defined, bounded plan</strong>: the number of games is
                capped by the series, the entries are set in advance, and the whole sequence targets a fixed 5 units.
                Because the stake grows each game, a full chase can risk a real chunk of bankroll — e.g.{' '}
                <span className="font-mono text-xs">5 + 10 + 20 = 35u</span> across a 3-game series to net 5u.
                That's exactly why the unit and bankroll guidance above matters: size your unit so a full failed
                chase is something you can absorb without flinching.
